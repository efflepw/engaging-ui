## Engaging UI lib

**At the moment**, it is a library of various UI components that feature interesting animations and effects.

**At the moment**, it is not available as an NPM package, but it is planned to be published soon.

**At the moment**, you can't see a preview of all available components; they need to be imported manually.

**At the moment**, components can't be used as-is for various situations, but you can reuse any code from the repository as you wish.
